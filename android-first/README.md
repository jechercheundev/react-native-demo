Add react-native to your project

```
yarn init
yarn add react-native
yarn add react
curl -o .flowconfig https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/react-native/master/.flowconfig

```

Now open the newly created package.json file and add this under scripts:

`"start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start"`
